# `bin/rails db:migrate` donâ€™t consistently modify both the development and 
# test schema. This can result in a test schema that is not the same as what's 
# described in the migration file, which can cause some confusing test 
# behavior. Rather than document this problem, let's use this script to handle 
# applying migrations.

echo "[ bin/db-migrate ] migrating development schema"
bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development

echo "[ bin/db-migrate ] migrating test schema"
bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
