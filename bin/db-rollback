# `bin/rails db:rollback` donâ€™t consistently modify both the development and 
# test schema. This can result in a test schema that is not the same as what's 
# described in the migration file, which can cause some confusing test 
# behavior. Rather than document this problem, let's use this script to handle 
# rolling migrations back.
